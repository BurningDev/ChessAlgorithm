# ChessAlgorithm

## General
The aim of this project is to develop a powerful chess computer. The algorithm is working and you can play against it.

## Setup & Instructions
In order to start the application, a **Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required**, because this software is programmed in Java. There are two factions in the game. The computer controls the black faction and the player controls the white faction. The player starts the first move. To be able to move a chess piece, it must be left-clicked to select it and then the target field must be clicked. Next, the computer starts its move.

## TODO
The chess board has almost all pieces up to now, however the queen and the bishop are missing.
* Adding Queen and Bishop

The chess algorithm is developed to the point where it can move its own chess pieces independently. You can also set the level of difficulty in the code. However, the algorithm needs more and more time the higher the difficulty level is set. A performance analysis and performance improvement should be carried out here.
* Test and improve performance

## Background
I started the project in 2017 and paused it for a long time. In the last weeks I had the motivation to continue the project again. I used the Min-Max algorithm as a guideline to develop the chess computer.
